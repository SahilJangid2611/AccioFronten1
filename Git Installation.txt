Installing Git:
Download Git:

Go to the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/.
Click on the "Download" button to download the Git installer.
Run the Installer:

Once the download is complete, run the Git installer.
Follow the installation wizard's instructions. You can usually leave the default settings as they are, but you may want to customize the installation directory or choose specific components to install.
Completing the Installation:

After the installation is complete, you may be asked to choose a default text editor and configure some other settings. You can typically leave these settings as their defaults if you're unsure.
Setting Up Environment Variables:
Open System Properties:

Right-click on the "This PC" or "My Computer" icon on your desktop or in File Explorer.
Select "Properties" from the context menu to open the System Properties window.
Access Environment Variables:

In the System Properties window, click on "Advanced system settings" on the left sidebar. This will open the System Properties dialog box.
In the System Properties dialog box, click on the "Environment Variables" button near the bottom right.
Edit System Variables:

In the Environment Variables window, you'll see two sections: User variables and System variables. We'll be working with System variables.
Look for the variable named "Path" in the System variables section and select it.
Click on the "Edit" button to edit the Path variable.
Add Git to Path:

In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on the "New" button.
Type or paste the path to the Git bin directory. By default, it's C:\Program Files\Git\bin. If you installed Git in a different directory, adjust the path accordingly.
Click "OK" to save the changes and close all the open windows.
Verify Installation:

Open a new Command Prompt window (press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter).
Type git --version and press Enter. You should see the Git version information if Git is installed correctly.
